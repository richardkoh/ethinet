# ethinet

This is a WIP draft and placeholder for a proposed protocol of communication that embodies the following:

* Identity inheritance

* Identity hierarchy

* Time-bounded resource access

* Query broadcasting

* Query publication

* Query expiry

* Delegated authentication

* Non-repudiable events

* Perpetual validated events

* Distributed authentication

* Distributed identity storage & validation

* Object embedded signature for identification

We believe that it is technologically possible and practical to create a decentralized
network where data ownership can be shared among its originator and processor.
