# ethinet

This is a WIP repository for an exploratory/possible protocol of communication that embodies the following:

* Identity inheritance

* Identity hierarchy

* Time-bounded resource access

* Query broadcasting

* Query publication

* Query expiry

* Delegated authentication

* Non-repudiable events

* Perpetual validated events

* Distributed authentication

* Distributed identity storage & validation

* Object embedded signature for identification

One belief is that it should be technologically possible and practical to create a decentralized
network where fine-grained joint ownership of data among originator and processor is explicit.
